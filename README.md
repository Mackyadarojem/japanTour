Explanation why it's the best:
  When visitors first open the website, they will immediately be immersed in the vibrant culture and ambience of Japan. The theme is inspired by Japan's dynamic nightlife, with a background that subtly dims as users explore different locations. The site features a daily weather update and an interactive map, allowing users to search for areas and focus on specific regions of interest. Additionally, in the bottom some of Japan's top tourist attractions are highlighted, offering visitors a glimpse of the must-see sights in the country. And the most important aspect of the design that I created is its responsiveness.
  In case of coding, I used PHP, jQuery, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and also utilized an API for the map and daily weather forecast. You'll see that the folders and files are well-organized, and I paid close attention to proper naming conventions for variables as well as indentation. I also made an effort to shorten the code, especially in conditions using JavaScript or jQuery. If you look closely, I also used HTML containing SVG code for a responsive map chart displayed on the website to enhance the design. The map on the website also focuses on the selected location chosen by the user when they search for a place.
